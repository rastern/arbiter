# Arbiter

*Arbiter* is a lightweight framework for working with data flows. These may be as
simple as capturing data from a REST API and writing it to a file, merging files
or even merging various sources into a single output such as a database. At its
core *Arbiter* provides a multi-process processor for handling inputs based on
*handlers*. Handlers may be written for any data source required.


## Installation

pip install arbiter
